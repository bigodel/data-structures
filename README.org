#+TITLE: Data structures

** Introduction

Here are implementations of diverse data structures in some different languages.
Each major data structure is organized in its directory, with each variation of
the data structure with its own directory, containing a directory for each of
the languages that data structure is implemented in. There might be an
implementation of the major data structure in an abstract way, like with binary
trees.

*** Motivation

I started this project as a way of having a deeper understanding of data
structures, of how they work, how I can improve them, and a better understanding
of the differences between various languages.
